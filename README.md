🗣️ Litt-Up – AI-Powered Audio Journal App
Litt-Up is an AI-powered audio journal app inspired by Louis Litt from Suits. Just like Louis used his recorder for therapy, Litt-Up lets you record your thoughts, reflect, and gain AI-driven insights to better understand yourself.

This project uses React with Vite for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and Python (OpenAI API) for AI processing.
